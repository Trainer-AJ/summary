  Here's an overview of these components:


---

🔧 Incident Management

    


---

🧩 Problem Management

Aims to identify and eliminate the root causes of incidents to prevent recurrence. This process includes conducting root cause analyses and coordinating with Change Management to implement solutions. 


---

🔄 Change Management

Manages the lifecycle of all changes to minimize disruption to IT services. It encompasses stages such as initiation, assessment, planning, implementation, and closure, ensuring that changes are systematically and efficiently handled.

## ITSM process types : 
Here’s a real-life example using a bank's mobile app to explain each ITSM concept:


---

1. Incident Management

Issue: Users can't log in to the app.
Action: IT logs the incident, prioritizes it as P0, and works to restore service quickly.
Goal: Get the login feature working again ASAP.


---

2. Problem Management

Finding: This is the 3rd login outage this month.
Action: A problem record is created. Root cause: overloaded authentication server.
Goal: Prevent future outages by fixing the root cause.


---

3. Change Management

Change: Dev team proposes replacing the old auth server.
Action: Change is reviewed, tested, scheduled, and deployed with minimal downtime.
Goal: Implement improvements without disrupting service.


---

4. Knowledge Management

Issue: Many users ask how to reset passwords.
Action: A “How to reset password” article is published on the help portal.
Goal: Help users self-solve simple issues, reduce support load.


---

5. Helix ITSM Insights (AI)

Scenario: AI notices spikes in failed login attempts every Monday.
Action: Recommends scaling the login service every Sunday night.
Goal: Proactively avoid Monday outages using data patterns.

You're right! Here's a continuation with Asset Management and Service Desk, using the same bank mobile app example:


---

6. Asset Management

What it is: Tracks all IT assets—hardware, software, licenses, etc.
Example:

The login server (where the incident occurred) is tracked in the CMDB (Configuration Management Database).

IT knows its owner, specs, warranty, and current health.
Goal: Know what assets exist, how they're used, and manage them efficiently.



---

7. Service Desk

What it is: The single point of contact between users and IT.
Example:

A customer calls saying “I can't log in.”

The service desk logs the ticket, gives updates, and escalates it to the right team.
Goal: Provide fast, friendly, and efficient support to users.
